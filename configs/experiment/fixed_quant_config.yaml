# Fixed quantization configuration
# Used for ablation study to compare with adaptive quantization

# Disable adaptive quantization and set a fixed K
quantization:
  adaptive: false # Disable adaptive quantization
  k_initial: 30 # Fixed number of quantization bins
  vmin: -5.0 # Narrower range for better resolution
  vmax: 5.0 # Narrower range for better resolution
